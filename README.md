## Wireframes

The wireframes were designed using templates from [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/ "Balsamiq Homepage"). I started with the mobile version, then tablet and finished with the desktop display.

## Design Choices

### Typography

The font family that has been chosen for the Science and Nature Quiz is [Red Hat Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Red+Hat+Display "Google Fonts | Red Hat Display") due to its low contrast and tighly spaced design which gives better legibility. Given that the quiz will have questions to read, legibility of the font is an important factor to increase the user experience.

### Colour Scheme

For the website background, I created some science and nature styled icons using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/ "ChatGPT Homepage") and placed them over a neutral background using [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html "Adobe | Photoshop") which created some of the the base colours for the website. I then included greens to help create a calm atmosphere while linking to science and nature. I used [Coolors Scheme](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors Scheme Homepage") to finalise the chosen colours and visualise them next to each other.

I then used [Contrast Grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23A09A8A%0D%0A%23D0E5C8%0D%0A%23899F7F%0D%0A%23000000%0D%0A%23FFFFFF&es-color-form__tile-size=compact&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp "Contrast Grid") to determine the best colour combinations to ensure the website will be visually appealing whilst remaining easy for the user to read the quiz questions and answers.
